[MUSIC] Welcome to types of plots. After watching this video, you'll be able to: explore different types
of plots available for visualizing data. Identify the characteristics and appropriate use cases for
each type of plot. As we know, data visualization
represents data using visual formats like graphs, charts and maps. It effectively communicates information,
trends and insights concisely, it also uncovers
patterns, identify trends and simplifies complex information for
easy understanding. Let's now explore the different types of
plots, some of these include line plot, bar plot, scatter plot,
box plot, histogram. A line plot, also known as a line chart, displays data as a series of data
points connected by straight lines. Line plots display trends,
such as stock market fluctuations or temperature changes over time, they compare datasets with a continuous
independent variable like age or time. Line plots illustrate cause and
effect relationships, such as sales revenue changes
based on marketing budget. They also visualize continuous data,
like height measurements over time. Line plots can be misleading if
the scales on the axes are not carefully chosen to reflect the data accurately. The line plot shows a downfall
in immigration trends in 1998, however, if you will correct the scale
on the y-axis to start with zero, as in this plot, you'll see that
the actual trend is not that alarming. Let's now explore the next plot. A bar plot, also known as a bar chart,
displays data using rectangular bars, where the height or length of the bars
represents the magnitude of the data. The bars can be oriented either
vertically or horizontally. A vertically oriented bar chart is often
referred to as a vertical bar chart or a column chart. If you're looking for an effective way
to compare data, bar plots are ideal for comparing different categories or groups. They excel with discrete data,
like comparing sales revenue by product. They show how different categories
contribute to the whole and rankings, such as sales percentage or
budget allocation. Bar plots can visualize data
that you can easily rank, like displaying the bestselling
books in the market. Their simplicity and interpretability,
make them favored for data visualization. Inaccurate bar choices or axis scales,
can lead to misleading plots. In this bar plot, the y-axis starting
at six, makes the difference between the values in 1995 and
1998 seem larger than it actually is. However, when the y-axis starts at zero, the plot accurately represents the data
without misleading the viewer. Now let's go through the next plot. A scatter plot,
is a type of plot that presents values for two variables for
a set of data using Cartesian coordinates. The data points are displayed
as a collection of points, where one variable's value determines
the position on the horizontal axis and the other variable's value determines
the position on the vertical axis. When can you use a scatter plot? Let's explore some options. You can use it for
examining the relationship between two continuous variables like temperature and
energy consumption. Investigating patterns or trends in data, such as house prices versus size,
detecting outliers or unusual observations such as outliers in
test scores or abnormal stock behavior. Visualizing data with many
observations to identify clusters or groups, and exploring complex data. Outliers significantly
impact interpretation, requiring consideration of
their inclusion or exclusion. On the screen, the data is plotted
with and without outliers. With outliers, it shows two clusters, but removing outliers makes
the remaining data more visible. Proper outlier handling, enhances accuracy
and meaningful insights in scatter plots. Let us learn about the box plot. A box plot, also known as a box and
whisker plot, is a type of plot that displays the distribution of a data set,
along with key statistical measures. It consists of a box,
representing the interquartile range, IQR, a line inside the box representing
the median and lines whiskers extending from the box to indicate the range
of the data, excluding outliers. Outliers may be represented as individual
data points beyond the whiskers. Let's look at some scenarios
where box plots come in handy. While comparing the distribution of
a continuous variable across different categories or groups. For example, employees salaries across
departments, examining spread and skewness of data set,
visualizing quartiles and outliers, identifying and analyzing potential
outliers within a data set. Visualizing summary statistics, median, quartiles, range in a concise and
informative manner, comparing distributions of multiple
variables in datasets side by side. Remember, box plots provide valuable
information about outliers, such as their presence and extent. Ignoring or mishandling outliers, can
distort the interpretation of the data and mask important insights,
same as with scatter plots. The last plot we're going to
learn about is the histogram. A histogram, is a graphical representation
of the distribution of a data set, showing the frequency or relative frequency
of values within specific intervals. It consists of bars, where the height represents
the data count in each interval. Histograms offer valuable
insights into data distribution, outliers, skewness and variability. They visually depict
the shape of the data, whether it's symmetric skewed or bimodal. Skewness can be assessed by
examining the histogram's shape. Histograms also showcase data variability,
allowing you to observe concentrations, gaps and clusters that reveal patterns or
subgroups. Apart from issues with scale and
inadequate labeling, be careful while choosing
the bins to create a histogram. We have generated a random data set and
created three histograms, with three different binning options. Too few bins, five represented in green
color, an optimal number of bins, 20 represented in blue and
too many bins 50, the yellow one. By comparing these histograms, you can
observe how the choice of binning affects the representation of
the data distribution and results in a misleading
representation of the data. Selecting too few or
too many bins, can oversimplify or overcomplicate the distribution,
respectively. In this video, you learned that, there are various types of plots
commonly used in data visualization. Line plots capture trends and
changes over time, allowing us to see patterns and
fluctuations. Bar plots compare categories or groups, providing a visual
comparison of their values. Scatter plots explore
relationships between variables, helping us identify correlations or
trends. Box plots display the distribution
of data, showcasing the median, quartiles and outliers. Histograms illustrate the distribution
of data within specific intervals, allowing us to understand its shape and
concentration. [MUSIC]
