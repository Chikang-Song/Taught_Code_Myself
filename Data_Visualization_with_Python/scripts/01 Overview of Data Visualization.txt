Hello, and welcome to overview
of data visualization. After watching this video, you'll be able to explain what data visualization is
and why it's important. Describe the uses for
data visualization. Explore the best practices
for data visualization. Data visualization is the
graphical representation of data and information. It involves the
process of creating visual representations of data. Data visualization can
take many different forms, from basic charts and graphs to more complex
interactive dashboards, maps, and infographics. Basic charts and graphs
are the simplest form of data visualization to
represent numerical data. Interactive dashboards and
maps are more complex forms of visualization to provide
real-time information. We need data visualization
for several reasons. Data visualization helps
us to easily understand complex datasets that might be difficult to comprehend
in their raw form. It can highlight
patterns, trends, and relationships
that might not be immediately apparent from
looking at the data. Visualization enables us to
communicate insights and findings to stakeholders in a more compelling and
understandable way. It allows us to tell
a story with data, making it easier
for stakeholders to understand and act on the
information presented. Visualization helps us
identify trends and data patterns that might
otherwise be difficult to see. We can gain new insights and
make informed decisions by examining data over time or
across different dimensions. Presenting data in a more easily understood
and interpreted way enables us to identify
opportunities, spot potential problems, and
make more informed choices. Let's explore how
data visualization can help us understand data. The New York Times, a well-known news publication, has used data visualization
to help people understand the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic in the United States. The number of daily
new reported cases and the number of deaths
are shown through a line graph and the vaccinated
population percentage is displayed using a bar graph. Airbnb uses smart pricing
framework to assist hosts and determining the best possible prices
for their listings, thereby increasing their
profits using a bar graph, the chart displays the
lead time distribution aggregated to a market level. Spotify uses Spotify Pie, a unique data visualization tool that enables
users to create customized pie charts based on their listening
habits on Spotify. The chart displays the
distribution of different genres, artists, and tracks the
user has listened to. What you see here is
a choropleth map on Netflix's Insight
Tool dashboard with other visualizations like
line graphs and bar plots. These dynamic
dashboards help them gain a deeper understanding
of operations, identify areas for improvement, and quickly address any issues. Data visualization
is an essential tool for anyone dealing with data. Companies can gain insights
into market trends, financial performance,
and customer behavior. Healthcare professionals
can identify patterns in patient data and develop
targeted treatment plants. Visualization helps analyze student
performance and inform instructional decisions leading to better academic outcomes. Visualization helps
governments make informed decisions and
communicate data to the public. Visualization helps
scientists and researchers analyze
complex data, develop new insights, and
share findings effectively. Visualization helps workers and the entertainment
industry determined ratings and
ultimately signals to the creators what
the audience wants. Although data visualization
has become an essential tool, not all visualizations
are created equal. To create effective
visualizations, it's important to follow best practices that can
help ensure that the data is accurately represented and the message is
clearly communicated. One key best
practice is choosing the appropriate
visualization type for the presented data. Different types of data require different
visualization techniques. Choose the right one to communicate that
data effectively. Keep the visualization
simple and easy to read. A line chart shows
trends over time. Well, a bar chart is ideal
for comparing values. To ensure that the data is
accurately represented, it's also important
to label the axis clearly and provide context
for the data being presented. Include a clear title, summarizing the main
message and a legend explaining the meaning of
any symbols or colors used. Including unnecessary
graphics or information, can confuse the audience and distract them from
the main message. Keep visualization
focused on the main point and use only the necessary
data and labels. Lastly, it's
important to consider the audience when creating
the visualization. Who will view the visualization? What do they need to know? The visualization should be tailored to their needs
and understanding. What do you think about this
plot or this pie chart? What is the data
trying to convey? In these charts, there
are a lot of variables and the information is more
difficult to understand. This is an example of
bad data visualization. This chart represents
a team's board. The stacked bars depict
the percentage of the work assigned to the individual
users and their work progress. Colors are distinguishable
and consistent. The legend shows the
individual color's meanings. The chart provides
more clarity with the values and percentages
on top of each bar. Darkhorse Analytics is a
company that was created out of a research lab at the
University of Alberta in 2008. The company has done
fascinating work on data visualization. Darkhorse Analytics
specializes in quantitative consulting
in several areas, including data visualization
and geospacial analysis. Their approach when
creating a visual revolves around the idea that
less is more effective, more attractive,
and more impactful. By following these
best practices, data visualizations can
become a powerful tool. Checkout the Darkhorse
Analytics website for examples of
good and bad plots. In this video, you learned that, data visualization
is the process of presenting data in
a visual format, such as charts, graphs, and maps to help people understand and
analyze data easily. Data visualization has diverse use cases
such as business, science, health
care, and finance. It's important to
follow best practices, such as selecting
appropriate visualizations for the data being presented, choosing colors and fonts
that are easy to read and interpret, and
minimizing clutter
