a marketing plan for the fourth quarter. Our tools are Copilot and Word. We will use Copilot as both a knowledge
assistant and as an expert user. We have opened Microsoft Word. There are two ways we can access Copilot. We see Copilot inline in the document and
we see the familiar icon in the toolbar. We click on Copilot inline and it invites
us to describe what we'd like to write. We are facing a blank screen. How do we begin? Notice that Copilot has a 2,000 character
limit on its prompt that is rather large. Many people begin with a simple prompt, an ecommerce marketing plan for
the fourth quarter. We are going to write a detailed prompt. What expertise should Copilot use? You're a multichannel expert
in ecommerce marketing. What's the output? A proposal for the fourth quarter,
keep the length to one page. The audience, it's the director marketing,
cover three topics, objectives, budget and
proposed activities. We are even going to caution
against unnecessary work. Copilot has generated a rather
interesting brief on our proposed marketing spend using our guidelines. The clear next step is to review it,
edit it, and make sure it reflects
our marketing program. Although we won't do that
in this demonstration. Remember, it is always our
job to review Copilot's work. We decide to keep it. Before we can proceed, we notice it is
hard to read and understand the budget. Let's ask Copilot to
be our expert user and help us reformat these bullets as a table. That looks very good, let's keep it,
but let's fine tune this table. We don't see total percent and total cost. Add a total spend to
the bottom of the table. That looks much better now. We need to summarize this document so that we can send it to
the director of marketing. Let's move over to use Copilot
on the toolbar ribbon, we'll use Copilot as our
knowledge assistant. We see Copilot offers us the opportunity
to summarize the document or to ask questions. We use the prompt suggested by Copilot. Our knowledge assistant
has produced a summary. The summary even includes
references to the source of the information in the document,
that is sweet. In this brief intro, we've seen how
Copilot can be a knowledge assistant by using the corpus of the LLN and
its ability to summarize text. We've also seen how Copilot
serves as an expert user. Formatting bullets as a table, we have been invited to review our
marketing plan for the fourth quarter. We will use Copilot to help
create our PowerPoint. We find the now familiar Copilot icon in
the toolbar ribbon and we click on it. Once again, we are facing a blank screen. Copilot offers a menu of prompts. We would like to create a presentation
from the document we just created. We choose this. Notice how convenient it
was to select the file. We choose this option and
Copilot adds the prompt to the dialog box. Only Word documents can be used by
Copilot to create a presentation. Those documents must be
already saved in the cloud. Copilot is informing us of the steps it's
taking to generate the presentation. Copilot generated the presentation. Indeed, the presentation is professional
and derived from our document. Not only does it include some compelling
images, it also has speaker notes and to be sure,
it includes the original content as well. To be sure,
our job is to review the content, edit it, make sure it reflects our thinking. But for now,
we will defer the content work. Let's go a little further and begin to
see what else Copilot can help us with. You select the first Copilot
icon in the prompt dialog area. It contains a menu of
well organized prompts. Create, Edit, Ask, while we can
certainly select one of these, I find it useful to view more prompts. We view the edit prompts and
we see organize your thoughts. Let's organize this
presentation into sections. We are saving ourselves from
repetitive work by asking Copilot to serve as our expert user. We view the presentation
in the slides order and we can see how Copilot
organized the sessions. In this brief intro,
we've seen copilot in action. It transformed our document
into a presentation, provided relevant images that
can spark our creativity, provided us with speaker notes,
and organized the sections. It has served as an expert user and
as an editorial assistant.
