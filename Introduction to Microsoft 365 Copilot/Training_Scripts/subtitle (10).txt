We need to analyze
the new dataset. Research did a
great job creating a small summary
spreadsheet for us. Copilot can only work
with an Excel table. It offers to convert
the table for us. That was fast. Let's take Copilot up on its offer
to show us data insights, even though I know
which direction, I think I need to
ask those questions. Copilot has shown
us age group by preferred style and offers
to add it to a new chart. It's a PivotTable, which can be very useful. It is not something I
would usually attempt. I'm going to add
it to a new chart, but let's go back and let's see how I would
do this from scratch. I really want to start by
looking at the age group and the region not satisfied
with their glasses. Let's look at this query. We asked to find out those not satisfied with
their glasses. Really, what we were asking was who are
moderately satisfied, not satisfied, not
very satisfied, not highly satisfied
with the sufficed. Copilot did not figure that
for us. We'll try again. We are now explicitly
looking for those moderately satisfied
with their glasses. It shows us that the regions that are moderately satisfied
are Asia and Europe, and we have a
distribution of that. We will add it to a new sheet. We see once again that
this is a PivotTable. Let's start to use
this PivotTable to help us better understand
what we're looking for. Up on top, it's
moderately satisfied, and here's an age
group and a region. The next thing we really want to know is the purchase frequency. We'll add that to
the filter column. Let's start to filter on that. What we're really
looking for are once a year or once
every two years. Let's see what we find. Our age group has
started to converge. Let's try to find out what the preferred style for this is. We have converged on
a preferred style. Let's see if we have account
of that just to be sure, and we'll summarize that. Well, that is excellent. We see that there are in total, there's Asia, Europe in
different age groups. Excellent. Our brand stands
for comfort and style. We will add a filter for comfort and style here. Let's
see what we have. We see. We have a couple. This is quite conclusive. It shows us that in
the 20-30 age group, and in the 60+ age group, there's a shared interest
in sport comfort, and as well as the eclectic, and these are folks that are to date
moderately satisfied. Excellent. We've
completed our analysis. I want to be sure
that I understand the age group and the region that is moderately satisfied
with their glasses. I've asked Copilot to
help me identify them, and Copilot has
shown me that there are three age groups
who are moderately satisfied and responded with a satisfaction level of
moderately satisfied. Now, the next thing
I asked Copilot is, what is the preferred style
for moderately satisfied, and I found two styles:
eclectic and sport comfort. What I next need
to understand is the purchase frequency
for eclectic, and the purchase frequency
for sport comfort. We see the purchase frequency for eclectic is once a year, and for sport comfort is once a year or
once every two years. Now, once I have these, I want to know what
are the regions and the age group for sport
comfort and eclectic? Here we have that we have these in Asia and
Europe predominantly. We are now looking for
price range for both of these for comfort and for
eclectic in Asia and Europe. We see that although there
are two price ranges, really the price
range is 100-180, and we could be consistent
in the offering. We have completed our analysis. Let's stop and reflect
on our productivity. First of all, the data was not formatted to be worked
with as an Excel table. Copilot eliminated
an impediment, so I could immediately
begin my work. I asked Copilot to send insights as the
second thing here. Insight was a summary
and basic visualization. I would have needed
to do this work. Copilot assisted me. I found the most value when I applied my own knowledge
and perspective. I built a series of questions
to explore the data. Because the data
was well-designed, my chain of thought was clear and allowed me
to step through this. I was engaged. I knew that our brand stood
for comfort and style, and that's exactly where my questions led me
through Copilot. I could have done it by simply
selecting and filtering, but Copilot allowed me
to think logically. Copilot created a
PivotTable for me. Once again, we're looking at it. This is not something
I do regularly, even though Pito Salas invented the PivotTable over
25 years ago to allow an expert analyst to
replace 15 minutes of complicated data table
and database functions with just seconds of work. I was able to quickly
use the PivotTable to validate my result
to derive a result, and now I have another
arrow in my quiver.
