Welcome back. In this video, I want to guide you
through a step by step demonstration of how to set up Copilot for your team. Ever wondered how you can get your team's productivity
kicked up a notch? Well, let me show you how with the right
tools and set up. A Microsoft 365
business plan offers you a fundamentally
different way to interact with Copilot. These business plans, the
standard business plans, you can see here on
the Microsoft website, it's likely if you already
have an enterprise edition, it's been purchased for you. What you can see here
is that you can add Copilot to your Microsoft plan. Let's go ahead and
learn more about that. You'll see that
Copilot for Microsoft 365 is also an
individual license. It's at $30 per user with
an annual commitment. Copilot for 365 business
and Enterprise editions, offer you a much more
expanded set of capabilities, including the ability to reference files and your
Microsoft Graph at work. Let's go ahead and see
what that looks like. Once you've gone
ahead and purchased Microsoft Copilot with a
business edition of 365, you'll either want to manage
the absent services or assign or unassign some
licenses and reassign them. In the Admin Center, you'll also be able to set up email with a custom domain
or save time with templates. These are advanced tasks and
we will not cover them here. We've now launched Copilot. This edition of
Copilot accompanies the business and enterprise
editions of Office 365. Right away, you can
see a difference. There's a work and a web slider, and we're on the web
slider right now, notice that it says
it's protected. Your personal and company
data are protected. As a practical matter, that means that if we ask Copilot some questions or
give it some information, it will not use our
information from our company or from our
queries in training it's LLM. Now we've gone ahead and
asked our question about innovations in
eyeglass technology. We see we have some information
that we can then go ahead and download into an export
into a Word document. Here you have it. We've saved that as Eyeglass Innovation. Now, I'm going to
switch over to work. Here's where I can actually
ask questions about the work about the files that are on my machine or
what I worked on. I've actually asked it a
very specific question, what word and PowerPort documents have I created
over the last four hours? Copilot actually knows
about that work I've done. What we've seen is Copilot using the Microsoft Graph of my files. It can also use the Microsoft Graph in or
I'll look at my emails. Here I'll ask it
about the emails I received about
eyeglass technology. Here I have all the
emails I've received. Now you've seen one of the significant
advantages of using Copilot with a business
subscription to 365. Let's go ahead and
use Copilot in Word. Here, I've opened a blank file, and I've simply named it Innovations in 18th century
Eyeglass Technology. I have two ways to
access Copilot. One is up here on the right
and it's familiar spot. The other, which we'll
begin with is right here in line and it says
draft with Copilot. Now, I'd like to
suggest to Copilot. What are three
innovations we use today from eyeglass technology? But here's the difference. I can now ask Copilot to
actually reference my content. I have a document eyeglasses
in the 18th century. I will ask it to generate that. Now, I can keep it. I can regenerate it. I'll go ahead and keep it. Now, just for comparison's sake, here's the document
that it referenced eyeglasses in the 18th century. Now, let's go ahead
and use Copilot. Here we'll see on the side, we can summarize this document, or we can ask a question
about this document. We'll go ahead and
Copilot lets us say, What did Ben Franklin contribute
to eyeglass technology? Here we see Copilot
in action with Word and the ability to
use and reference files. That is very important
in a business setting. Now that we've worked
