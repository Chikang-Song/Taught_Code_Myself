[MUSIC] Ever wonder what makes Copilot
in Microsoft 365 so capable? I'm going to explain
generative AI to you so you understand how it uses your prompts,
your work context, and how you should be the guide to correcting
Copilot's responses and improving copilot. By the end of this video,
you will understand the role of large language models, LLMs,
in powering Copilot's responses. You'll recognize how
Microsoft Graph enhances Copilot's understanding of your
personal and organizational context. Rob Rubin here, guiding you through
the maze of technology behind Copilot. Imagine Copilot as more than
just a chat interface, think of it as a bridge connecting you with
the vast AI capabilities of Microsoft 365. Let's first take a look at
the architecture behind Copilot. At the heart of Copilot lies
a large language model, or LLM. This AI algorithm is not just any tool,
it's a powerhouse of knowledge trained on enormous
datasets to understand and generate human-like responses,
but it's not infallible. Some computer scientists have referred
to the LLM as a stochastic parrot. They call the LLM a stochastic
parrot because it can replicate language without actually
understanding its meaning. If you've heard about hallucination or
received wrong responses, the stochastic parrot analogy may hold. Computer scientists are responding
to the stochastic parrot challenge with a skill mix test. The skill mix test is an evaluation
method for AI models applying multiple skills not seen during training,
to demonstrate understanding. It is utilized to challenge AI models
with tasks that require varied skill combinations to go beyond
the replication of training data. The test provides insights into AI models
capabilities beyond simple mimicry, highlighting their proficiency in
synthesizing diverse knowledge. Therefore, the responses you see from
Copilot use much larger models like GPT-4, which have been validated
by the skill mix test. That is because without proper context, even the most powerful LLM
can trip over its own feet. Now that you know a little more about
the large language model powering Copilot, let's take a look at the Microsoft Graph. It acts as the connective
tissue between your data and Copilot, ensuring that every
prompt you feed is grounded in the specific context of your work or
organization. This grounding process is what turns
generic responses into tailored advice, making Copilot's assistance precise and
relevant. We've journeyed through
the technological landscape that makes Copilot not just a tool, but
a companion in your daily tasks, with LLMs providing the brainpower and
Microsoft Graph ensuring the context. Copilot stands behind Microsoft's
commitment to innovation and personal productivity. Now, let's start experimenting
with your prompts in Copilot. See how this technology not
only responds but adapts, making your workday smoother and
more efficient. And observe how Copilot refines its
responses when you refine your prompts. [MUSIC]
