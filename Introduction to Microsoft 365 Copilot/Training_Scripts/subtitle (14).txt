Have you ever found
yourself struggling to get the precise help you need
from Office 365 Copilot? Imagine if you could
master the art of asking to turn your interactions with Copilot into a more
efficient experience. In this video, you're
going to learn just that, the simple yet powerful
technique of crafting prompts called
prompt engineering to get you exactly
what you need. By the end of this
video, you will one, craft clear and
specific prompts that enhance your productivity
with Office 365 Copilot. Two, you'll use contextual information to
improve Copilot's responses. Three, you'll apply natural
conversational language to communicate
effectively with Copilot. Welcome to the final
lesson in Copilot for Microsoft Office 365
with me, Rob Rubin. Today we're going to talk
about prompts and prompting. Would you like to improve the responses that
Copilot gives you? Just like your
communication with others improves over time, so can your prompting with
co pilot be improved. In this video, I want to teach you the anatomy
of a good prompt. We will compare the output
from examples obtained from ineffective as well
as effective prompts, and discuss why these
responses are different. Then, we will look at how to improve ineffective prompts
to get what you want. Like a native New
Yorker would joke, how do you get to Carnegie Hall? You get there by practice,
practice, practice. Let's get started. First, let's see what effects clarity and
specificity have on our prompts. Let's consider following prompt examples for
this situation. You've moved to a
new company and you want to let your old
clients know you've moved. Let's ask Copilot
to write an email. Copilot, draft an email to my former client mailing list and tell them I've
moved to a new company. What is Copilot going
to do with that prompt? Well, it was a simple prompt, so it shouldn't be
a surprise that co pilot has provided a
pretty simple result. Let's look at a more
detailed prompt. Copilot, please write the
email to my colleagues, explain to them what
my new company does, and why I've chosen
to join the company. List the top interesting
products the company offers, which I'd be happy
to talk with them about in a follow up meeting. Please provide them with my new email address
and a new contact card. Now we can see that there
is more to the prompt. Copilot has provided a
more detailed response. But let's actually spend some time comparing the
results of those two prompts. We can see from
example 1 that we provided co pilot
with a vague prompt. In the second example, Copilot could utilize
context awareness. The AI needs to understand
not just the direct request, but also the context in
which the request is given. This includes the relationships between the sender
and recipients, the formality level, and any important information
that should be included. Let's talk about the
Microsoft Copilot prompt, 101 formula to help
us understand what makes an effective prompt
specifically for Copilot. It's a very simple
four part formula. By following this formula, you will improve
your prompts and they will eventually
become second nature. Start with a goal,
then provide context. Now, add the sources
for reference, and lastly, set the
expectations of the prop. To explore these,
let's put ourselves in the shoes of Jess who has recently graduated
from college, and is looking to write a
cover letter for their resume. Jess is planning to apply
to Mayfly Biotech as a data scientist and join the
Bioinformatics department. Let's apply the 101
formula to our scenario. We need to start with the goal. What type of response do
we wind from Copilot? For our scenario, we
want to cover letter. Copilot, please create a cover letter for the role
described in this file. Secondly, you want
to add context. State why you need this
cover letter written, who is involved, and
say what you need. Here's a context prom
for our scenario. I want the cover
letter written to the project lead.
Please be formal. Now, for sources, we need to tell
Copilot where to find the information you want it to use in creating the response. Use the job description
and my resume as sources. Finally, specify to Copilot what your expectations
are for the response. These could be based
on the structure, word count, number
of paragraphs, and the tone you
were looking for. Here is an expectation
prompt for our scenario. In the paragraph, describe
how my skills fit the role. In the second paragraph, describe the projects
I have worked on. In the second paragraph, use bullet points to describe the projects
I have worked on. In the final paragraph, describe how the company's
mission inspires me. Close with how excited I
will be to join the team and how I'd be excited to learn and contribute to the
team and the company. Make the tone friendly and use bullet points where useful. Now we can see our
full completed prompt that shows the goal, the content, the sources,
and the expectations. A conversational
AI assistant like Copilot, integrated
with Outlook, can leverage natural
language processing, NLP, to help users compose emails more efficiently
and effectively. This involves understanding
the user's intent through conversational prompts
and generating draft emails that align
with the user's goals, the context of the email, and the relationship between the sender and the recipient. Let's consider a scenario
where Carlos wants to draft an email to their team
about an upcoming meeting. Instead of starting
from scratch, the user can engage with Copilot by providing a prompt
in natural language. The generative AI understanding
the task, the time, the subject matter, and the urgency crafts
an email draft. Take a minute to read
the prompt and really understand how the
interaction might unfold. Pause the video now, Carlos can then
review the draft, make any necessary
adjustments, and send it. Copilot's role is to provide
a strong starting point, reducing the time and effort
needed to compose the email. Now, pause the video here and take some time to
read Copilot's response. Let's summarize. GenAI help you and your
company in a big way. It's more powerful
than you imagined, but you are in control
of the responses. The responses you'll get from Copilot have to do with how
you formulate your prompts. Now, practice iterating
your prompts in Copilot and see how your
responses have become refined. Your prompt engineering,
your prompt design, and the way you
write your prompts will improve over time. It's your biggest lever.
