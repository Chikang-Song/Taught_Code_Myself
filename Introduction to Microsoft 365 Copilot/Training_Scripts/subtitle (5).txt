Ready to unleash the power of Copilot. In the following video, you will
work with me through a step by step demonstration that shows you how to set
up Copilot for personal and team use. We'll be covering licenses and customizations showing you how
to step up your productivity. By the end of this lesson,
which is divided into two videos, you will be able to set up Copilot for
both individual and team use. We will highlight
the prerequisites of licensing and how to access Copilot within Office
365 applications for word and PowerPoint when demonstrating
your setup for individual use. You will learn to configure Copilot for
team productivity and recognize data security considerations
while safeguarding sensitive information. We'll learn how to configure Copilot to
provide context by adding reference files in word to understand and apply this
technique to optimize Copilot suggestions. You will discover how to set up
templates in PowerPoint to guide Copilot in generating content aligned with
your team or brand guidelines. Welcome to our Copilot setup
demonstration, Rob Rubin here together we'll unlock the full potential of this
generative AI assistant, whether for individual or team use, and I will
guide you through this step by step. Let's get started with setting up Copilot. You've installed Copilot Pro,
let's start to explore it. Here we have three things we can
get creative, balanced, or precise. When we choose the creative option, we actually have the option of GPT4 or
GPT4 turbo. Now I'm just going to go ahead and
ask Copilot to go out to the web and tell me about technologies in eyeglasses. One thing I can do with this now is I
can either copy it or I can export it. I'll export it to a word document,
and here we see it's been exported with all of
the sources associated with it. Now let's go back to Copilot and
we've saved the document, let's see what we can do. One of the things we can do here
is we can actually check and open open a document
that we've created and we can ask it to summarize for us. And here you can see Copilot's
ability to use a file. This is very significant and one thing that certainly differentiates
Copilot Pro from Copilot. Copilot can also help troubleshoot
your Microsoft Office challenges or
any other challenges you might face here. I don't know what challenges you might
face when you have installed word, but let's see if Copilot can help it. Here are two ways that Copilot
has instructed us in order to diagnose challenges, and
it's done it very accurately. The first is you might have
to go to file account and check your update options and
say update now. The second is you might have to update
your license, well done, Copilot. Let's go ahead and use Copilot in Word, now here you can see I've
opened a blank document. There are actually two ways to access
Copilot in word, one is through the blue icon on the top right, and
the other is actually to use it in line. So let's go ahead, click on that and draft Copilot, let's ask Copilot to give us an overview
of eyeglass technology. Here we have created a rather
large document, and so we know that Copilot is successful. I'm just going to move
over to Copilot Pro and let's see what Copilot Pro can do for
us here. It can summarize this document for us. As we'll see later,
we can even ask questions about this document,
we now have Copilot in word. Now let's begin to use
Copilot in PowerPoint. We find Copilot up on
the right once again and let's try and just create a slide. We're going to ask it to add
a slide about Benjamin Franklin and the creation of spectacles. Notice how Copilot has
gone out to the web and found information about
Benjamin Franklin and created a slide automatically for
us, Swee. We've now opened Excel and
we're ready to try Copilot here, we find the icon in the upper right and we notice the first thing is
that Copilot is in preview. This is Microsoft's way of letting
us know that the results may not be as accurate as we like, and
they are still developing this software. We can immediately try
an example in Copilot, and we can even ask it to saw suggestions for
formula columns right away. And so here's an engagement rate
of each campaign, and go ahead and insert the column. We'll learn much more
about this as we go on. That does it for understanding how to
set up your family subscription or your personal subscription with Copilot. Well done, everybody, together let's unlock a new level
of productivity and collaboration. [MUSIC]
