just landed in my inbox. Carlos wants our iglass launch plan asap,
I've been expecting this. What are the deliverables
Carlos is looking for? Copilot provides a summary of the email,
I'll click on that. That was a very clear summary, my job is to analyze the new market
research data and build a launch plan. My first step is to
conduct the data analysis. Then I'll test some taglines in a regional
market with the target demographic. I need to communicate
with Carlos of my plan to take this on Copilot
can help me draft this. I'll share my immediate job, I'll share
my first step and my second step. I'll share that I'll communicate and
I do notice that Carlos did close with a familiar quote,
you are a Jedi. So I'm going to ask to close
with a quote from Star wars. As Yoda would say, do or do not,
there is no try I'll keep it. Let's stop and reflect on how
this impacted my productivity. The first thing I needed to do was confirm
my understanding of the key points of the request. Copilot was able to quickly
summarize the key points. I needed to inform Carlos and communicate to him my understanding and
our next steps. Copilot provided a draft and
I accepted it, it might not have been quite my voice,
but it was good enough to get going. Finally, I wanted to connect with
Carlos and find the right quote. There was no stepping out for
a search and browsing the web. I did remain focused on
the document with Copilot. The focus and fun made me feel productive. Do or do not, there is no try. [MUSIC]
