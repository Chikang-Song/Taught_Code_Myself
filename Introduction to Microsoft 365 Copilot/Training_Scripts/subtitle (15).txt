[MUSIC] Ever found yourself tweaking
a PowerPoint slide over and over but not quite hitting the mark? Imagine being able to refine your approach
using technology that allows you to communicate clearly. In this video, you will refine prompts
iteratively to enhance the quality of outcomes when working with Office 365
Copilot, and incorporate specific examples in your prompts to guide
Copilot's responses more effectively. Welcome to Iterating on Prompt, where we unlock the power of prompt
engineering with O 365 Copilot. With me, Rob Rubin, as your guide,
we will explore how subtle changes in your prompts can yield significantly improved
results from your copilot responses. To really understand how to iterate and
refine prompts, let's use a scenario. Let's follow along with Alfred, someone who is greatly
involved in their community. Alfred has decided, as part of their
e-commerce company's community outreach, to create a presentation on
the chestnut tree, intended for a citizen science project for
his company's community service day. First, Alfred starts
with a simple request. The first thing Alfred could do to create
a presentation is complete the supplied prompt. Create a presentation
of the chestnut tree. Now, do you think Alfred is feeling lucky? He would rather start from
a Copilot created presentation than face a blank screen. Let's take a look at what the outcome
is from the original prompt. Initially, the prompt is broad,
yielding a general outcome. Now, Alfred has decided to refine
his prompts through iteration. To achieve this, Alfred typed a much
larger and more detailed prompt. Create a presentation
of the chestnut tree. The audience is my colleagues. I want each slide to tell a story. In this context,
tell us about the chestnut tree ecosystem, its history and its cultural uses. Include a section on foods and recipes using the chestnut
across different cultures. Add slides about four different
foods from chestnuts. Conclude by telling the sad story of
the blight and its restoration efforts. Okay, what did Alfred get from
the refined and iterated efforts? Let's take a look. Wow, the life and legacy of
the chestnut tree, Castanea dentata. Isn't that wonderful? It has even created a very
beautiful animation. Copilot has created slides about
the cultural significance of the chestnut tree and
the ecosystem surrounding these trees. And it's even gone and
created speaker notes for Alfred. Because Alfred also asked it to tell
us the story of the chestnut blight, what it is, and its restoration efforts, Copilot has also provided
a few slides on these. And there we go. Alfred has speaker notes and
a very interesting presentation. Alfred can go and show his colleagues
that chestnut blight is a fungal disease that wiped out most trees
during the early 20th century. By refining our prompt, we see a marked improvement in
the presentation's depth and relevance. Now, let's learn how we can improve our
outputs through iterating our Copilot responses, and also, how this is
different from refining prompts. Let's stick with the first scenario
where Alfred created the PowerPoint presentation on the American chestnuts and
chestnut blight. But in the next scenario, we will look at
how Alfred iterates his prompts to add on to the original responses
received from Copilot. Alfred decided that it will be worthwhile
adding a little tidbit on the significance of the American chestnut to
the First Nations, Native Americans. Because Alfred will iterate his prompts,
each prompt will incrementally add more features to the final
PowerPoint presentation. Alfred now uses the following prompt to
iterate the next response from Copilot. Please add information on how the
chestnuts were a crucial food source for the Native American tribes. By adjusting his approach,
Alfred created a single additional slide about the chestnut significance
to Native American tribes. This focused task illustrates how
specifying examples can direct Copilot to generate richer content that is
more aligned with the objectives. Alfred decided he does not want to
end his presentation with a sad conclusion on how chestnut blight
wiped out the trees and stop there. So Alfred iterates on
his last response and asks Copilot to conclude the presentation
with an additional slide about any successful forestry and
recovery efforts made to date. Alfred adds the following
iteration prompt. Please add an additional slide and
information about any successful forestry and recovery efforts made to
date to eliminate chestnut blight and restore the chestnut
tree numbers in America. Make this the new conclusion
to the presentation. And here we see the forestry and
recovery efforts and the restoration. Copilot has added four slides. Okay, our results, we've generated
content which we have developed incrementally through iterating
prompts from the original response. We've created a story with depth and
different parts, and we have concluded the presentation with some positive
feedback which is factual and current. As you can imagine, we can iterate some
more to develop some additional sections. We could add iterating
prompts to add a slide for some Q&A, as well as a thank you slide. Personally, at the end of work like this, I like to make sure all
the fonts are the same. Particularly, my personal affection is for
the font Aptos. So I can add a prompt, for
example, asking Copilot, please change all fonts used
on all slides to Aptos. You can even now go and add different
font sizes for headings, subheadings, and body text, and you can ask Copilot to add transitioning
preferences in your presentation. And that is how Alfred can very quickly
develop an impactful PowerPoint presentation. In this video,
we explored the processes of refining and iterating prompts and the strategic
use of examples to guide Copilot. This approach not only improves
the quality of outcomes, but also enhances our
interaction with technology. And through some scenarios, I've shown you
how we've taken the whole chestnut tree, that very large, beautiful tree, told its
story, asked for some specific facts, refined our prompts to get better details,
and a much more coherent slide deck. Now, try to create your own slides for
an upcoming presentation you may have. Start experimenting with your prompts
in Copilot, and notice how refining and iterating these can significantly
enrich your communications. Remember, the art of prompt engineering
is a skill that grows with practice. Let's iteratively refine,
inspect, and adapt. [MUSIC]
