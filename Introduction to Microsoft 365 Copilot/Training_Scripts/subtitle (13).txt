[MUSIC] Together, we are going to take a set of
sample data about eyeglass preferences and analyze it in Excel. We will then use our analysis to
build our marketing proposal in Word. Finally, we will share and
enhance our findings in PowerPoint. Copilot will be critical to our
success at every step in this journey. You need to download the relevant files
found in the reading before continuing the video. Pause the video if you have not yet
done so. Are you ready to begin? Let's first start by launching Excel and
opening the downloaded document. I've clicked on blank document and I've headed over to the file menu
to open files from this device. I'm going to open the eyeglass
market research file. We want to work with the column
satisfaction level as a number so that we can write a formula
that filters the data. First, we will open copilot and request
that it convert the text into a number. Here is the prompt, computer column satisfaction from
satisfaction level as follows. Highly satisfied is a five. Satisfied is a four. Moderately satisfied is a three. Copilot has created a formula for us. We can request Copilot
to explain the formula. We can see the exact formula and
we can gain insights from this. After I review it, I'm going to
go ahead and insert the column. Pause the video to add this
prompt to your workbook. How many of you have experienced
a worksheet with textual information that is difficult to use? As you have seen, Copilot can help
you write these complicated formulas. Let's try to gain some insights
into the eyeglass attributes that are considered highly satisfied. We're going to go ahead and
sort and filter based on items with the recommendation as a numerical
value greater than or equal to four. Here's our prompt. Sort and filter where satisfaction
level is greater than or equal to four. You can see fours and fives in the table. The preferred styles, class and
modern leave these categories. Pause the video to add this
prompt to your workbook. If you see only fours and fives in
your table, then you were successful. I'm going to go ahead and
clear all filters. That is good hygiene so that we can see what insights
we might uncover in the data. I'm going to ask Copilot for assistance. Here is the prompt, clear all filters, pause the video now to clear
the filters in your workbook. Let's analyze our data to see if
there's any correlation between preferred styles and age. The prompt I'm using to do this is
analyze preferred style by average age. This has already been
done in your workbook. Take a look at the tab titled average age. Did you observe that the average age for
classic is 50, while eclectic style trends
several decades younger? We've got one more important question
that can utilize the same technique. We'd like to see if there's a correlation
between between important factors in satisfaction. This could give us some insights into
why people buy the eyeglasses they do. Here's the prompt. Analyze satisfaction by important
factors before I submit this prompt, try it out for yourself. Once again,
this looks like a fascinating result. What we find here is technology seems to
have the highest recommendation level, followed by vision change. Were you able to reproduce these results? We've inserted our two significant
findings into a document called eyeglass findings. Please upload that document. I've clicked on summarize this talk and
gotten a summary. Please try that yourself. Once you have reviewed or iterated on it,
copy it into the document. As you can see,
I've copied the two main ideas. Now that we understand that technology
is the most important factor, I'd like to go ahead and
ask Copilot to help me research that. You go ahead and you could ask
Copilot some questions as well. My prompt was one of the five
most important technologies for consumers in eyeglasses. The results are very relevant. I'm going to copy that and take that right
into my Word doc, you can do that as well. Copilot Pro provides a button
that makes it easy to do that right beneath the results. I've gone ahead and
copied that right into my Word doc. Copilot can help us
visualize this information. I've clicked on Copilot inline and
asked to visualize as a table. You can pause the video and
try that as well. Let's ask Copilot to help us
frame our recommendation. Here's the detailed prompt I
use based on the section titled Consumer Technology and
Eyeglasses in this document. Write a recommendation that we investigate
the availability of these technologies and their benefits. Follow that by naming the benefit and
framing the question to the consumer. Here's an example, 3D printed frames. Would you enjoy frames that fit you so comfortably that you think they
were made exactly for your face? The answer smart glasses. Would you like to access the Internet,
take photos, and control your smart devices
with just your glasses? I'll keep it. Yeah, you pause the video and
construct your own prompt. Be sure to review your output. Congratulations. We've completed our Word document and
our research. We have now headed over to PowerPoint, where we prompt Copilot to create
a presentation about the five most innovative technologies for
consumers and eyeglasses today. Pause the video and
create the presentation. Copilot summarized information from
its LLM about these innovative technologies that prepare visually
compelling and creative presentation. The topics include
antireflective coatings, digital progressives, smart glasses. How does your presentation
compare to the one in this video? Now, let's take a look back at
all of our exercises today. We use Copilot and Excel to find
important insights in our data. In our Word document,
we use Copilot to further our research and summarize our recommendation. Copilot and PowerPoint pull together a targeted
overview of my eyeglass technology. Well done. [MUSIC]
