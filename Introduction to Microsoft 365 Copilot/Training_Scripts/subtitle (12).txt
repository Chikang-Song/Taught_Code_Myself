Let's get an interim result to Carlos
that he could look at quickly. We know he absorbs fastest and
small chunks in PowerPoint. Let's generate the PowerPoint
from our file. CoPilot has generated an interesting
set of recommendations. Here we see it's targeting Asia and
Europe. Here it's talking about
sport-comfort styles and the reasons for that. And it's gone into some details and even provided us with data
insights about the age group and what they might be interested in and
their price range. We'll need to edit this just to send
a few over, but I think our job is done. Let's stop and reflect on writing the
analysis of the data and the presentation. To start, CoPilot helped me summarize and
format some of the data. I actually found that very helpful. I needed to spend think
time on the recommendation. I want the insight I generate from
the data to stand behind this. I don't want CoPilot GenAI to use data
from its LLM corpus of knowledge. I need it to reference my
specific company data. I had to be sure to reference
our well researched information. I don't want unreferenceable
information in my documents. I've highlighted particular
areas in the document where our reference material
became very relevant. Finally, I needed generate
a PowerPoint in order to inform Carlos of my most
immediate thinking. PowerPoint was able to use
a draft of research data insights in order to generate a rather
large 14 slide presentation. I had to cut that to four. What I particularly appreciated was
the generation of speaker notes and the images that were
included in the PowerPoints. That did save me some time. I also appreciated
the generation of the table and the generation of the final recommendation
on what they are and some of the taglines. Nicely done. As we conclude this journey through
