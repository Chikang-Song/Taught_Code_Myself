[MUSIC] We are now going to use Copilot in Excel. We find Copilot at its familiar spot
on the ribbon at the far right, colored in Excel green. Nice job, graphic designers. As we see,
Copilot in Excel is in preview mode. The first thing you'll notice is that
Copilot only works with Excel tables. Copilot provides an example,
and we'll go ahead and use it. The table describes a set
of marketing campaigns and shows the budget and the revenue. It also has data about the number of
users targeted in the campaign and the actual engaged users. We want Copilot to be
our expert Excel user. We want to see the most revenue generated. An experienced user would
know to click on the small icon in the column
header in order to sort. We will prompt Copilot to sort the table
by revenue from largest to smallest. As we can see, the prompt was not
quite as fast as clicking the icon. But it certainly allowed us to
keep our train of thought and to communicate naturally. And here we have it. Can Copilot tell us about the data? Let's prompt Copilot to highlight
the campaign with the largest revenue. We can see Copilot applied
a green fill color and a black font to the top item
in the column, Revenue. Let's ask Copilot to be
a knowledge assistant. ROI is a standard calculation
return on investment. Let's ask Copilot to add
a column with the ROI. We can look at the formula and
the explanation. We now understand why Copilot
requires an Excel table. An Excel table makes it unambiguous
to refer to the columns by the name in the table header. Copilot uses the budget and
revenue in its ROI formula. Let's finish up our initial
exploration by asking Copilot to produce a pie chart
of revenue by campaign name. We've added the pie chart to a new sheet. Our visual cortex discerns that 50% of the revenue came from three campaigns. Thanks to Copilot,
we have a new way of working. Copilot has served as
an expert user of Excel, performing simple tasks such as sorting,
creating a pie chart. It has also been a knowledge assistant,
writing formulas and explaining them, and
even using a standard term such as ROI and applying the column names to create
the formula in our spreadsheet. We've worked in a new way with Copilot,
using our natural language to communicate. In conclusion, this video showcases the
unique twofold function of Copilot 365, making it both a reliable assistant for
managing everyday tasks and a creative partner that brings new
