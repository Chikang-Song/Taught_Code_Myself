[MUSIC] I've copied the questions and
the Excel data into my document so that I can prepare an interim
briefing PowerPoint. I'm looking to assemble a set of notes and
think through my recommendations. Let's bring up Copilot and
see how it can help us. I'm going to start with seeing if Copilot
can actually summarize my thinking. Copilot has observed
the most preferred styles, taken my look at moderately satisfied
customers identified them as from Asia and Europe, as well as looking at
where they source this data from. They found the eclectic and
sport comfort styles as the ones where customers
value comfort and style. And the price range for
this is between $80 and $200 and they've even assimilated
that information from the $100 to $200 and
$80 to $180 price range. I'm going to copy and paste that summary
into my document and here we have it. I look at the selection and
I think perhaps this would be better off if I could have
a better visual presentation. I'm going to go see if I can
visualize this as a table. Here we have it, quite nice. All the information in a summary. We have our data,
we now need to write a recommendation. Let's draft that with Copilot. We're going to ask for
a recommendation on the eclectic and sport comfort styles between $80 and $200. So here we have a very brief introduction. We'll keep it nicely done. This time, we want to try something else. We know we already have some
content we'd like to use. We're going to go reference that
content and ask the same question. We've added our content consumer
trends had generated by our research department and
now let's see what comes through. We find a very telling paragraph
here that is based on our data. It's popular among middle aged
consumers who are facing the challenges of aging populations and
I'd say single living. And they're also suitable for
younger consumers who look for advanced technologies for
home convenience and comfort. We will keep it. We're close about done with our work. We want to update Carlos. Let's first add some recommendation. We'll keep it.
