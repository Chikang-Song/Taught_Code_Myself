Ever found yourself
in a sea of data, wondering if there's
a faster path to make sense of it all? What if I told you there's
a tool that helps you navigate through the data
and analyze it as well? Let's see how
Microsoft 365 Copilot can be your expert assistant. Hello again. Rob here. It's time to embark
on another journey, this time into the depths
of data and decisions. We're going to explore
how Copilot transforms data analysis into
a smooth sail. We'll follow Alex and
Sarah as they harness the power of Copilot across
Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. By the end of this video, you'll learn how to
navigate through complex structured
data with Copilot, manipulate the
table, get insight, and even have Copilot
help you write and explain more
effective formulas. We'll use Copilot to increase your productivity and focus, turning data analysis from a task into a
competitive advantage. Imagine Alex, a 32-year-old data analyst, swamped with data, needing to make quick
informed decisions to show her colleague a dashboard
that she can play with. With Copilot, Alex provides natural language
prompts asking for a digest of proposed
marketing spending. She also asked questions
about the data. Alex asked Copilot to build a new formula and a
column for the data. Copilot writes the formula
and explains it to her. Alex prompts Copilot to build a pie chart to
understand the data. Alex knows her colleague is very capable and may want to
play with the data herself. With Copilot and
without much effort, Alex builds a pivot
table enabling her colleague to further
analyze the data if need be. Thanks to Copilot, Alex not only stays
afloat but also charts a course for success,
armed with insights. With the help of Copilot, Alex is now able to analyze the data and summarize
the highlights. Let's meet Sarah, the
marketing manager of Alex's project. Sarah needs to make some
strategic decisions about the next quarter. She has just received Alex's
analysis and so she turns to Copilot asking for
a comparison of her company's performance
against competitors. Using its generative AI, Copilot is the companion
to Sarah as she generates a detailed set of decisions grounded in Sarah's
specific objectives. With assistance from Copilot, Sarah builds a document
which summarizes the data, the analysis, and
her recommendations. Sarah uses Copilot to generate a presentation with
her recommendations. She asked Copilot to add an important
observation to the deck. Copilot helps her write a summary email and she is ready for the
decision-making forum. Sarah's strategy goes from being a shot in the dark
to a guided missile, thanks to her insights and the assistance of her
assistant, Copilot. We've seen how Copilot can be your compass in the data ocean, helping you make sense of
vast information and making your strategic decisions
clear and articulate. Alex and Sarah's stories
are just the beginning. With Copilot, you're equipped to turn data challenges
into opportunities. Do you feel ready
to self-navigate through the data
with confidence? Let Copilot be your
guide and let's turn those data-driven decisions
from daunting to doable. Go ahead and use Copilot
in either Word, Excel, or PowerPoint to help you
generate some insights using the downloaded
datasets we've used above in the scenarios
with Alex and Sarah.
