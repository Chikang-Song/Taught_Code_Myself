- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer programmer was actually a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician in the 1800s, is often credited as the worldâ€™s first programmer. She wrote an algorithm for Charles Babbage's early mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine, even though it was never completed in her lifetime. Her work laid the foundation for programming as we know it today!
